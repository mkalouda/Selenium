Alerts:
-- Alert is a pop up message. It takes complete focus of our main page that we are working on.
    We can not proceed until it is handled.

    3 types of alerts:
        1. web based alerts/ html alerts
            -- we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
        2. Javascript alerts/ browser alerts
            -- we can handle these alerts by using switchTo() method
            -- we cannot inspect
        3. windows based alerts
            -- we cannot handle with selenium

    Types of Javascript alert
        1. simple alert - can simply click on ok
        2. confirmation alert = either cancel or click ok
        3. prompt alert - enter text and then click ok
    -- to handle JS alert we only have 4 methods
        1. accept();
        2. dismiss();
        3. getText();
        4. sendKeys();

Frames:
-- frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
-- frames allow devs to present multiple views in one page

    3 ways to interactive with frames:
        1. by index
        2. by name or id
        3. by webelement

in alerts -- switch to alert manually and switch back automatically
in frames -- switch to frames manually and switch back manually
