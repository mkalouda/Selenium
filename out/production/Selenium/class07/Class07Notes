Handling multiple windows:
-- In order to handle multiple windows we will be using
    -- getWindowHandle()
        - window handle is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or tab
        - It is approximately 40 alphanumeric character ID
    -- getWindowHandles()

Synchronization
-- is the process of bringing the speed of two or more components to the same level
-- in this case we are bringing our script and page load to the same speed level

    Thread.sleep() - static wait/unconditional wait

    Types of selenium waits:
        1. implicit
        2. explicit
        3. fluent

    implicit wait:
    -- it tells the webdriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
    -- it will be written only once and will be applied for the whole session of the execution
    -- we can say the implicit wait is a global wait
    -- is usually set to 20 seconds. if your element is found in any given time prior the rest of the time will be
        ignored and your script will move on to the next action
    -- if the element is not found in a given time, ONLY then you will get an exception
